# kontainment/engine
`kontainment/engine` is the singular backend for the kontainment tooling.

It runs as a daemon process similar to how Docker's container engine works with Docker Desktop.

In the future there will be both a CLI and GUI front-end to interface with the backend engine.

TODO List:
- Figure out the exec request path
- create a client pkg
- create a daemon
- create the CLI
